## Project 1: Car Purchasing Prediction

### Overview:
This project aims to predict whether a customer will purchase a car based on various features such as age, income, gender, and car preferences. 

### Tools and Technologies Used:
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

### Key Steps:
1. Data Collection: Gathered data from various sources including customer surveys and demographic information.
2. Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared the data for analysis by handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Explored relationships between different features and identified patterns.
4. Model Building: Trained several machine learning models including logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests.
5. Model Evaluation: Evaluated the performance of each model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
6. Deployment: Deployed the best-performing model for real-time prediction.

### Results:
- Achieved an accuracy of 85% on the test data.
- Identified key factors influencing car purchasing decisions.

## Project 2: Iris Classification

### Overview:
This project involves building a classification model to classify iris flowers into three species (setosa, versicolor, and virginica) based on their sepal and petal dimensions.

### Tools and Technologies Used:
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

### Key Steps:
1. Data Collection: Obtained the famous Iris dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
2. Data Preprocessing: Checked for missing values and standardized the feature scales.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized the distribution of each iris species and examined the relationships between features.
4. Model Selection: Experimented with different classification algorithms including logistic regression, support vector machines, and k-nearest neighbors.
5. Model Evaluation: Evaluated model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
6. Model Tuning: Fine-tuned hyperparameters to improve model performance.

### Results:
- Achieved an accuracy of 95% on the test data.
- Successfully classified iris flowers into their respective species with high precision.

## Project 3: IMDB Movie Sentiment Analysis

### Overview:
This project involves analyzing IMDb movie reviews to predict whether a review is positive or negative.

### Tools and Technologies Used:
- Python
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

### Key Steps:
1. Data Collection: Scraped movie reviews from IMDb using web scraping techniques.
2. Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and tokenized the text data, removed stopwords, and performed stemming/lemmatization.
3. Feature Extraction: Represented the text data using techniques such as TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).
4. Model Building: Trained various machine learning models such as Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines for sentiment classification.
5. Model Evaluation: Assessed model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
6. Deployment: Deployed the sentiment analysis model for predicting sentiment on new movie reviews.

### Results:
- Achieved an accuracy of 90% on the test data.
- Successfully classified movie reviews into positive and negative sentiments with high accuracy.
